# Hermes Fullstack – EPITECH Brussels Capstone

Welcome to the **Hermes Fullstack** GitHub Organization! This space is dedicated to our fourth-year (tek 4) cybersecurity Capstone project at EPITECH Brussels. Our mission is to create an educational cybersecurity platform that introduces junior pentesters and students to real-world web security practices—aligned with the **OWASP ASVS Level 1** framework.

## About Hermes Fullstack

Hermes Fullstack is a **comprehensive cybersecurity training and vulnerability demonstration platform**, developed by a team of four EPITECH Brussels students. Our key objectives:

1. **Provide Hands-On Experience**  
   Practice identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled environment.

2. **Demonstrate OWASP ASVS Level 1 Flaws**  
   Show typical pitfalls in areas like authentication, session management, and access control.

3. **Offer Practical Tools**  
   Includes a Python-based web scanner and a user-friendly Ionic/React dashboard to manage scans, view reports, and learn about core security concepts.

For detailed setup, usage instructions, and component breakdown, visit the [Hermes Fullstack repository](https://github.com/yourusername/hermes-fullstack).

> **Important:** Parts of this project are intentionally vulnerable. **Do not** deploy to production or any public-facing servers.
